Title:
Optimizing Training Cost for Scalable Graph Processing

Abstract:
The DE-HNN model is a state-of-the-art (SOTA) graph neural network model
to predict congestion using circuit netlist representation, outperforming other
hypergraph and netlist models in both node-based and net-based demand re-
gression tasks. However, its high computational demands pose a significant
barrier to practical deployment, limiting scalability and efficiency. To ad-
dress this challenge, our research focuses on exploring strategies to optimize
the training cost of DE-HNN, in terms of memory usage or training runtime
while preserving prediction quality. We systematically tune hyperparame-
ters and profile metrics to analyze the trade-offs between computational cost
and accuracy, aiming to identify the optimal balance between efficiency and
performance across various model configurations.
